Description: It provides functions to estimate parameters in spatial linear models with 
  censored/missing responses via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm 
  (see Dempster, Laird, and Rubin (1977)<https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984875>), 
  the Stochastic Approximation EM (SAEM) algorithm (see Delyon, Lavielle, and 
  Moulines (1999)<https://www.jstor.org/stable/120120>), or the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) 
  algorithm (see Wei and Tanner (1990)<doi:10.1080/01621459.1990.10474930>). These 
  algorithms are widely used to compute the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates in 
  problems with incomplete data. The EM algorithm computes the ML estimates when 
  a closed expression for the conditional expectation of the complete-data 
  log-likelihood function is available. In the MCEM algorithm, the conditional 
  expectation is substituted by a Monte Carlo approximation based on many independent 
  simulations of the missing data. In contrast, the SAEM algorithm splits the E-step 
  into simulation and integration steps. 
  This package also approximates the standard error of the estimates using the 
  method developed by Louis (1982)<https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345828>. Furthermore, 
  it has a function that performs spatial prediction in new locations. It also allows 
  computing the covariance matrix and the distance matrix.
